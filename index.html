          <p style="margin-left: 1rem; margin-right: 1rem;"> You're either here cause you're Professor's making you sit through this (same bestie) or because you're grading (in that case, hi Professor!)</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-left: 1rem; margin-right: 1rem;"> I'm Maryam. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in computer science from the University of Indianapolis with a minor in computer engineering and math. I enjoy building things.I like building things, whether it’s with code, hardware, or even just ideas scribbled down on paper. This site is a little corner of the internet where I share what I’m working on, what I’ve learned, and a bit about who I am.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-left: 1rem; margin-left: 1rem;"> I’m the kind of person who enjoys figuring out how things work (and occasionally taking them apart just to put them back together). Curiosity drives me — sometimes that means diving into algorithms and circuits, other times it’s just learning something new for fun. I also care a lot about creating things that are not only functional but meaningful, whether that’s through tech, teamwork, or personal projects.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-left: 1rem; margin-left: 1rem;"> Outside of school and projects, I’m just me — someone who enjoys good conversations, new experiences, and the occasional rabbit hole of research that starts with “I’ll just Google this real quick.” I like connecting with people who are passionate about something and are willing to talk about it for hours to come (ps: I'm a yapper too. But I enjpy being yapped to aswell.) Plus, it gives me an excuse to try something new.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-left: 1rem; margin-right: 1rem;"> Feel free to explore around, check out my projects, or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maryam-imran17/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://github.com/im4ryam/">GitHub</a>. And if you're here just ot poke around, you're welcome too!</p>
